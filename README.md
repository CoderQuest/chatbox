# Chatbox
This is my attempt to practice using redux and firebase to create a real-time chat messenger between 2 chat boxes.

## Demo
* Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:CoderQuest/chatbox.git`
* Run `node server.js` then open `localhost:3000` and select `user1`
* Open a second `localhost:3000` tab and select `user2` 
* Chat away!
